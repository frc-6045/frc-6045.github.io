    <h1><img src="Sabre_Robotics_Logo.png" alt="Sabre Robotics Logo" style="width:25px;height:25px;">FRC 6045 Programming Website!</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to make it easier to find programming-related things that are used or made by FRC 6045.<br><br><br></p>

<h2>Version control guide</h2>
    <p>To ensure that code is not lost and that it is able to be easily accessed by multiple countributors and devices, version control, specifically using Git, is incredibly useful. GitHub is a website that can store repositories, or code, online. To contribute, you must clone the GitHub repo.<br><br>
    Commits are changes to the code a contributor makes. Generally, you should commit fairly often to keep track of progress. Make sure to save all of your changes you would like to commit. To keep changes organized, it is possible to commit only certain changes.<br><br>
    Pushing and pulling code keeps your local code on your device and the remote, source code up to date.<br><br>
    Sometimes, when multiple contributors edit the same code, there will be a merge conflict when you try to sync code. Resolve them by going through the conflicting changes manually and choose what to keep or change.<br><br>
    Whenever you make major or experimental changes, create a new branch. When it is working well, merge it to main.<br><br>
    Terminology differs across different Git interfaces, like the command line, VSCode's built-in source control, GitHub, and GitLab, so don't get hung up if you have experience with Git outside of GitHub Desktop.</p><br><br><br>
